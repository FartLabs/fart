# New version

FartLabs generates code that involves Porygon service/server for deploying Fart code.

Perhaps Fart generates code in Porygon's standard library and Porygon is used in generating code for Fart.

Conveniently set up new environments in the cloud like `tf apply` but for Porygon.

## Porygon

Porygon is a service for asserting the existence of required resources such as databases, servers, and other services.

## Fart

Fart is a tool for generating code in multiple languages.
